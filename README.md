# sample-app
This a simple unity app where you can move 3D objects. You can resize the 3D object by rolling the mouse wheel up and down, pan it by clicking on the mouse wheel and moving the mouse, rotate it 360 degrees by clicking left and rotating the mouse, and move it by clicking right and moving the mouse. After logging out and logging in again the 3D shapes will remain in the same position they were left at.
